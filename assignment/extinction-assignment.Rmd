## The Sixth Great Extinctions

*Is "the 6th mass extinction" coming, or is it just an allusion ?*

Understanding the current pace of extinction and how it compares with the background extinction rate is important, as it will inform us the future of conservation effort.

## Background

In this report, we aim to reproduce the extinction graph from the above paper of Ceballos and colleagues. We want to show the recent increase in extinction rates relative to the background rate:

![](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/extinctions.jpg)

Before everything starts, we set up the functions that we need to use to run the code

```{r include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("httr")
library("jsonlite")
library("glue")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=NA)
```

## Data Download

We download the data that we need from ICUN redlist. Since the original website is slow as multiple request start at the same time, we extract data from the pre-download zip from our github.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/espm-157/extinction-template/releases/download/data2.0/extinction-data.zip", "extinction-data.zip")
unzip("extinction-data.zip")
```

To keep things simple, we create a local version of rds so we do not need to download it again and again. This rds will be our data to look at.

```{r}
 if(!file.exists("all_species.rds")) {
   all_species <- map(all_pages, GET)
   map(all_species,stop_for_status)
   write_rds(all_species, "all_species.rds")
 }
```

So setups are finished and we can load the data! From here we begin our data analysis to to answer our question: if the sixth extinction is happening, and how does it compare to the backgroud extinction rate?

```{r}
all_species<- read_rds("all_species.rds")
all_resp <- map(all_species, content, encoding = "UTF-8")
```

So now we find out there are so many information in the dataset, we will extract information that are most helpful. We want to know the scientific name of the species, their category, and their class. After getting these information, we merge them into a list that we call "all species". Since we want to focus on the extinction species, we will filter the category by "EX", whichstands for extinction. In this case, we have the whole list of species that are extinct.

```{r}
sci_name <- map(all_resp, \(page) map_chr(page$result,"scientific_name")) |>
  list_c()
category <-
  map(all_resp,\(page) map_chr(page$result,"category")) |>
  list_c()
class <-
  map(all_resp,\(page) map_chr(page$result,"class_name")) |>
  list_c()
all_species <- tibble(sci_name, category,class)

extinct_species <- all_species |> filter(category == "EX")
extinct_species
```

```{r}
ex_sci_name <-extinct_species$sci_name
```

Since it's still a lot of data, we want to storage it to local to save our process as well. rds will be our working format and we do the same things as before.

```{r}

if(!file.exists("ex_narrative.rds")) {
  ex_narrative <- map(all_pages, GET)
  write_rds(ex_narrative, "ex_narrative.rds")
}

```

Read the rds file and we will start finding the extinction rate.

```{r}
ex_narrative <-read_rds("ex_narrative.rds")
```

## Data Conversion

So we want to use map function to extract the information from the rds file to the list of words that can have information about the extinction data. These information will be in plain text that is not in a consistent format that we can find the number directly.

```{r}
narrative_contents <- map(ex_narrative,content)
narrative_population <- map(narrative_contents,
                            \(content) map_chr(content$result[1],"population",.default = ""))
narrative_rationale <- map(narrative_contents,\(content) content$result[[1]]$rationale)

```

So how are we going to get dates from plain text? Regular expressions. We start simple and just grab any 4-digit numbers, we will just trust it as year (which there are two errors and we ignore it with the huge data set we have). Now we will find out the extinction time and species category. We will group by class, arrange by century, and limit it for the five big vertebrates. We will have numbers of extinction in each species and order by centuries; we will calculate the extinctions per million-species-years, to see what will present use the extinction rate.

```{r}
last_seen <-narrative_population |>
  map_chr(str_extract,"\\d{4}") |>
  as.integer()
extintion_dates <- tibble(sci_name = ex_sci_name,last_seen) |> distinct()
combined <- all_species |> left_join(extintion_dates)
total_sp <- combined |> 
  filter(class %in% c('MAMMALIA', 'AVES','AMPHIBIA','REPTILIA', 'ACTINOPTERYGII')) |>
  count(class, name = "total")
final_tbl <- combined |> 
  filter(category == "EX") |>
  filter(class %in% c('MAMMALIA', 'AVES','AMPHIBIA','REPTILIA', 'ACTINOPTERYGII')) |>
  mutate(last_seen = replace_na(last_seen, 2023),
         century = str_extract(last_seen, "\\d{2}")) |>
  count(century, class) |>
  left_join(total_sp) |>
  mutate(extinct_perc = (n/total) *10000)|> # extinctions per million-species-years
  mutate(century = as.numeric(century),
         century = ifelse(century < 21, century + 1, 21))
final_tbl
```

## Data Visualization

Now we want to make cumulative extinction rates, so we do mutate a new rate of extinction.

```{r}
cum_data <- final_tbl %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  arrange(century) %>%
  mutate(cum_extinction = cumsum(n) / total * 10000)

# Remove grouping to return to the original state
cum_data <- ungroup(cum_data)
```

Finally, we will plot out the graph that have century on the x-axis as time, the extinction per million species per years conversion on the y-axis, and the five chosen species as the lines on the graph. We also added a background extinction rate of 2 species per million per year, indicated on the graph.

```{r}
background_slope <- 2

ggplot(cum_data, aes(x = century, y = cum_extinction, color = class)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = -27, slope = background_slope),
              linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = 18, y = 0.1, label = "Background Extinction Rate", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Extinction Over Centuries",
       x = "Century",
       y = "Cumulative Extinction per million-species-years") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 21, by = 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"))
```

## Conclusion

Compared to the original image, the current image lacks data on earlier extinctions. Although the data are consistent in the 21st century, we find little record of sustained extinctions in the 15th to 17th centuries. This is related to the method we use to find the year, we only consider the four-digit number to be the year when extracting the data, which makes us have A lot of early data without a specific year and recorded in the century can not be extracted, resulting in a large number of N/A. To ensure our statistical accuracy, we have to date these extinctions to 2023 to reduce the impact of changes in the image. This also resulted in a relatively low rate of early extinction. In addition, our analysis divided vertebrates into five parts instead of four, which also affected the trend of some data. Finally, we extracted two data years incorrectly in the process of judgment, but we corrected them.

In general, with the increase of human activities and the increase of human population and industrial level, we have significantly higher than the background extinction rate, which proves that we have entered the sixth mass extinction with a high probability. And the rate of change in this extinction is fast enough to prove that it was caused by human activity. In the future, we need to continue to pay attention to the ecological impact of extinction, which may lead to further destruction of the fragile environment suitable for human survival. In a warming climate, extinction rates will only increase. We need to pay special attention, otherwise the future extinction may be the human race.
