## Project

All of our project are in the `assignment` directory.  We worked in the `.Rmd` notebook, and commited our rendered output files (`.md` and associated files) in the `assignment` directory as well.

In this report, we aim to show the recent trends in extinction rates of different animal groups relative to the background rate. Our main goal is to view the current pace of extinction in comparison to background extinction rates, which informs the conservation challenge facing us. We found that all animal groups have experienced drstically increasing extinction rate from 18 to 19th century, resulted from to a large extent human activities that may include direct hunting and habitat destruction. The extinction rates all go significantly higher than the background extinction rate. The graph we created indicated that extinction rates is increasing and may lead to the "sixth mass extinction" in future if we humans exacerbate our negative impacts of ecosystem, such as climate change. We need to pay special attention to conservation of nature, otherwise the future extinction may happen to the human race.
